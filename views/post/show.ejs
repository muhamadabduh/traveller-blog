                    <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year
                        mission:
                        to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where
                        no
                        man has gone before.</p>

                    <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a
                        fundamental
                        truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
